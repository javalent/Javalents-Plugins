# Explode

**Syntax**: `XdX!{n|i}`

Explode will roll an additional die for each maximum die roll. If `{n}` or `{i}` is provided, it will continue exploding until a number less than the maximum is rolled, or `{n}` attempts have been made. `{i}` is capped at 100 rolls to prevent abuse.

Exploded dice will display as `N!`.
