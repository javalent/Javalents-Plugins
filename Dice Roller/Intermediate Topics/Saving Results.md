The Obsidian Dice Roller plugin allows you to save the results of dice rolls in your notes. You can do this using the [[Dice Roller Settings#Globally Save Results|Globally Save Results]] setting or the following syntax:

| Syntax       | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dice+: xdy` | Save result. Same as `dice: xdy` if `Globally Save Results` is on.         |
| `dice-: xdy` | Do not save result. Same as `dice: xdy` if `Globally Save Results` is off. |
