## Dice Rolling: Important Common Enquiries

### Conditional Rolls

#### Percentage Conditional Based on Amount

How Do Iâ€¦ Make a Dice Roll/Result only show when more than a declared amount?

To make a result driven conditional dice roll for a treasure table use the following formula format:

`dice: 1d%<50*(4d6*100-1d100)`.

`1d%` is the percentage die.
`<50` is the conditional number that needs to be beaten.
`(4d6*100-1d100)` is the additional dice roll to be evaluated.

If the result is zero, nothing is displayed. 
`dice: 1d%<50*1d4[[note^Table]]|2nd header|nodice`

This method works well for most OSR tables that use % for treasure generation. If the treasure value is higher than the % roll, it displays 0 for gold, copper, silver, etc. on the table. If it's under the %, it shows the combined roll and nothing if it's over.
