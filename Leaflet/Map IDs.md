# Map IDs

> [!feature] This functionality was added in Leaflet version 3.0.0.

%% #Version/3-0-0/Leaflet %%

Map ids are required for each map block. If you open an old map block without an ID, the plugin will remind you to add one.

Once you assign an ID to an old map block, the plugin will attempt to associate its marker data with the new map.


````yaml
```leaflet
id: leaflet-test-map
```
````
