# Distances

To display the distance between two points on the map, you can Shift or Alt-click on the map or a marker, and then Shift or Alt-click again.

Distances are shown in meters by default, but you can specify a scale factor and/or unit in the map block to customize this.

You can view the last-calculated distance in a control box located in the bottom-left corner of the map. Hovering over the box displays the distance line on the map, and clicking it zooms the map to those coordinates.
