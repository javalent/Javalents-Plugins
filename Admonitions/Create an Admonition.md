# Create an admonition

To create an Admonition, we'll need to first go to the [[Admonitions/Settings#Add New|Admonition Settings]] to enter the menu to actually create the admonition.

## The steps

1. Navigate to Obsidian's Settings
2. Select Admonitions from the Plugin List
3. Select **Add New** from the first set of options in [Settings](Admonitions/Settings.md).
4. In the new window that opens up:
	1. List an Admonition Type. This will be the name used to call it into codeblock or callout form
	2. If desired, choose a default title
	3. If desired, opt out of no title by default. Enabling this will require a `title:` in the top of the admonition to create a title
	4. If desired, tell admonitions to show a copy button
	5. Select an admonition icon. You can either use your own, or select one of the included icons from the [Icon](Admonitions/Metadata%20options.md#Icon) packs.
	6. Choose whether the color is created via CSS, or stored within .json. If choosing the .json option, also select your color from the color picker.
