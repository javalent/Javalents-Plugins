# Import an Admonition

[[Admonitions/Admonitions|Admonitions]] allows the import and export of [[Admonitions/Types of Admonitions|custom Admonitions]], as determined in the [[Admonitions/Admonition Settings|Admonitions Settings]].

## Obtain an Admonitions.Json File

In order to import an Admonition, you'll need an admonitions file. 

If you do not already have one, you can check out some admonitions available at both the [ObsidianTTRPGShare](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/ObsidianTTRPGShare "Github") and [TTRPG-CLI](https://github.com/ebullient/ttrpg-convert-cli/tree/main/examples "Github") repositories.

Once you have your file, move on.

## Admonitions Settings

1. Open the Admonitions settings within Obsidian.

2. Navigate to the option named "Import Admonition(s)."

> [!abstract] Some assembly may be required
> Some Admonitions rely on styling CSS more than others, in which case, you ought to grab the available CSS files as well. These PF2E Admonitions are one such case.
> You can bypass the coloration and color it directly by editing each admonition to use the CSS color from the Json file.
