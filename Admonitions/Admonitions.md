3.  Set default titles, default collapse states, or default no-title options for the callouts you create with Admonitions.
4.  Admonitions includes editor suggestions to speed up the process of creating custom admonitions and callout boxes.
5.  Admonitions provides helpful commands for inserting callout boxes and the ability to register commands for specific types.
6.  Get access to a free FontAwesome Icon library, with options for Opticon and RPG Awesome.
