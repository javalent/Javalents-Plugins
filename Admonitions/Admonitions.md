## Features

Here are the features that Admonitions can offer to enhance your note-taking experience:

1.  Create either a code block or a callout using Admonitions.
2.  If you have Microsoft Document syntax admonitions, Admonitions can auto-convert them to the new callout box syntax with the click of a button.
3.  Set default titles, default collapse states, or default no-title options for the callouts you create with Admonitions.
4.  Admonitions includes editor suggestions to speed up the process of creating custom admonitions and callout boxes.
5.  Admonitions provides helpful commands for inserting callout boxes and the ability to register commands for specific types.
6.  Get access to a free FontAwesome Icon library, with options for Opticon and RPG Awesome.
7.  Check out the Obsidian TTRPG-Share's [Repository of Admonitions](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/ObsidianTTRPGShare/tree/0a8b23a52fcf6129ddae9fc21a2e7433f83cc343/System-Agnostic/admonitions "Github") for some starter admonitions.
