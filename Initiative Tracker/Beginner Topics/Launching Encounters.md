The plugin allows launching encounters by clicking the "**Begin Encounter**" button, which will launch a <b><u>new encounter</u></b> as defined in the encounter block. 

Alternatively, users can add creatures to an existing encounter by clicking the "**Add to Encounter**" button.

It is important to note that if a default party is defined, it will control what players are added to an encounter. Users can override this by specifying a different party or by specifying `party: none`.
