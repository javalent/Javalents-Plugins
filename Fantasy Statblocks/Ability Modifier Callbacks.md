# Ability Modifier Callbacks

## Math Adjustments

### Halve and Round Down

In order to round down, we need to use the `Math.Floor` function as this works in both whole and decimal number cases. 

This example halves 10, and returns `5`. 

```js
return Math.floor((stat - 10)/2)
```

However, if the number was not a nicely divided number such as 13â€¦

```js
return Math.floor((stat - 13)/2)
```

It would initially calculate to `6.5` and then. round it down to `6`.
