The majority of your interactions with Fantasy Statblocks will start and end with this piece of code block language.

````yaml
```statblock
monster:
```
````

The programming code syntax used within Statblocks is YAML. YAML is defined as "human-friendly data serialization language for all programming languages" by [yaml.org](https://yaml.org), and it is a very powerful syntax used in multiple areas of Obsidian.

However, it's syntax is very strict, and you will need to pay attention to the spacing, the indentation, the quotations, and the colons in this section carefully, or you may receive errors.

The good news is that because it is designed to be human-readable, the errors are easy to catch by a fellow human, or even a helpful [YAML Linter](https://www.yamllint.com).

Without further ado, let's get exploring Statblocks.
