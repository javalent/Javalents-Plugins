On this page, you'll find a [[Glossary/Code Block]] containing the basic layout for Fate Core in Fantasy Statblocks. 

This layout can be used for entities, factions, locations, items, and more - all you need is a name and some aspects.

## Sample Image

### Modifying Layouts

If you want to add or modify custom stress tracks, you can create a duplicate of the layout and edit the `stress block` accordingly.
