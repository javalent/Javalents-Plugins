In Web Development, a Bootstrap is a collection of CSS, JavaScript, and/or HTML components and tools that help developers build responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications. It  provides a pre-built grid system, typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other user interface components, as well as JavaScript plugins for things like modals, carousels, and tooltips.

It's about time Statblocks had one for layouts, right?

## Page Order

The Pages will go in order of how you should work, as we are working from the outside of the Statblock inwards. Between each change you make in the file, you will want to save, and re-render your "test statblock" to see what changes have been made. 

## Bootstrap Files

You can grab the entire zip of the Bootstrap files below, or you can download them per page.
