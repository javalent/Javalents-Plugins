## Duplication

>[!tip] Before editing an existing statblock layout, we recommend making a copy first. This is because in an update to the plugin we may tweak an existing layout, and your changes would be reset.

Within the Fantasy Statblocks Settings, perform the following actions:

1. Navigate to the Layouts portion of settings
2. Click the double-box icon, which should have the alt text "Create a Copy."

Voila, you should now have a layout that says "Copy of Layout Name Here."

## Editing

A further in-depth guide is coming, but for now, here is a quickstart. 

1. On your new layout copy, select the pen icon, which may look like a diagonal eraser. The alt-text should say "Edit".
2. [[The Layout Editor]] will open up.
3. Rename the Layout up top. You will need to Save twice for this change to take effect; once on the rename, and once again by saving the changes to the entire layout.

> [!important] Making a Pathfinder 2e Layout? Keep "Pathfinder 2E" in the name to pick up the CSS from the default layout. Also let @Sigrunixia or @Lemons know if your layout needs to be added to the official CSS.

4. Re-open the layout to edit.
5. Make Changes to it as you will. 
6. Update your Statblock Codeblock. See [[Basic 5e Layout|Basic 5e Layout]] as an example. 
	1. You will need to have `layout: Your Layout Name` within the Code block or else Statblocks will apply your default.
7. Keep Testing
8. Add some [[Custom CSS]] in a snippet if needed 
9. More Testing against different themes. 
10. Maybe one day you are done.. but you'll end up tweaking it more. :)
