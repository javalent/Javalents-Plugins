# Maps Codeblocks

Maps has support for two different codeblocks; Real Maps, and Fantasy maps.

Real maps are, as you guess, real-world maps that you would recognize from GPS maps.

Fantasy maps are images modified to work as maps, such as in table-top games.

The specifications for both have their own idiosyncrasies, and will be detailed in their respective sections.
