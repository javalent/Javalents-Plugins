# Documentation

- Do you see any areas of documentation that are unclear?
- Do you think there is a section that you want to expand on?
- Do you want to add a funny note, a song, or a sarcastic vibe?

Create a [[Github Issue]] in the appropriate documentation repository stating what you think should change. If you are creating an Issue on how you would like to contribute, please include two sample paragraphs of your writing. 

- **1st Sample**: *Narrative/Storytelling Writing*. Much of the documentation mixes between using metaphor and analogy to explain concepts that would otherwise not be beginner friendly. 
- **2nd Sample**: *Technical Writing*. In certain cases, we do revert to Technical Writing, which is very formalised and very micromanaged. It is expected when writing in this way, anyone can perform these steps and reach the result. 

Both of these can be freestyle. It could at first be a storytelling guide about how to cook, and then a very technical recipe about making a really good sandwich. Have fun with it. These samples are not a test or to judge, but an ***introduction to you***. We'll never say no to help. 

Nor, will we be hypocrites. What we ask of you, we are willing to do:
