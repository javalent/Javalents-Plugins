# Documentation

- Do you see any areas of documentation that are unclear?
- Do you think there is a section that you want to expand on?
- Do you want to add a funny note, a song, or a sarcastic vibe?

Create a [[Github Issue]] in the appropriate documentation repository stating what you think should change. If you are creating an Issue on how you would like to contribute, please include two sample paragraphs of your writing. 

- **1st Sample**: *Narrative/Storytelling Writing*. Much of the documentation mixes between using metaphor and analogy to explain concepts that would otherwise not be beginner friendly. 
- **2nd Sample**: *Technical Writing*. In certain cases, we do revert to Technical Writing, which is very formalised and very micromanaged. It is expected when writing in this way, anyone can perform these steps and reach the result. 

Both of these can be freestyle. It could at first be a storytelling guide about how to cook, and then a very technical recipe about making a really good sandwich. Have fun with it. These samples are not a test or to judge, but an ***introduction to you***. We'll never say no to help. 

Nor, will we be hypocrites. What we ask of you, we are willing to do:

> [!example]- Sigrunixia's Narrative/Storytelling Writing Sample: Making a Sandwich
> When creating the perfect sandwich, it is important to get into a present mindset so you can decide what your creation will be based on what options you *are desiring* in that moment. A salted pork and some berry jam, or perhaps a cucumber and cream cheese. Savory? Sweet? Spicy? Rye? Pumpernickle? As with a curry or a taco, there can be too many options with a sandwich. 
> 
> But pick you must.
> 
> Start by choosing the bread. If aiming for more sweet fillings, consider using a heartier or more sour of a bread to absorb moisture and temper the mouthfeel of endless sweet. Then, choose your dressing condiments. If using multiple condiments, remember: The higher the viscosity of the condiment, the closer to the bread it shall be. This prevents the flavors from getting lost in each other. Next, if using lettuce, chard, greens, sprouts, or another high-moisture content topping, firmly dry the topping before adding to the sandwich. If using tomato slices, wait to apply these until just before you eat.

> For the next layer, add your thicker vegetables and sturdy fruit slices, such as peppers, onions, or strawberries. This is also a good time to add any cheeses or thicker cuts of meat.
>
> Finally, for your innermost layer, add your star of the show. The egg salad, the potato and bean filling, the thin slices of smoked meat, or a big hunk of brie. This should be thick enough that in a cross-section, you can clearly tell this makes up 1/3 of the sandwich.\*

> Now, repeat the process in reverse. When you place the final slice on top, let it settle for 2-3 minutes to give the condiments and moisture to seep into the bread. When ready, eat the sandwich as is, or cut into slice(s) to appreciate the aesthetics of your meal.

> [!example]- Sigrunixia's Technical Writing Sample: Making a Sandwich
> For your sandwich: 
> 1. **Ingredient Evaluation and Selection**
>     - Assess desired flavors and preferences before assembling the sandwich.
>     - Consider options such as salted pork with berry jam, cucumber with cream cheese, and various combinations of savory, sweet, and spicy elements.
> 2. **Bread Choice**
>     - Opt for bread that complements the desired filling flavors.
>     - Select heartier or slightly sour bread for sweeter fillings to balance moisture absorption and taste.
> 3. **Strategic Condiment Application**
>     - Apply condiments with varying viscosities according to their proximity to the bread.
>     - Place higher viscosity condiments closer to the bread to prevent flavor diffusion.
> 4. **Managing Moisture-Rich Toppings**
>     - Thoroughly dry lettuce, chard, greens, sprouts, or other high-moisture toppings before adding them to the sandwich.
>     - Add tomato slices just before consumption to preserve texture and freshness.
> 5. **Layering Thicker Ingredients**
>     - Integrate bulkier vegetables, robust fruit slices (peppers, onions, strawberries), cheeses, or substantial meat cuts to enhance texture and flavor complexity.
> 6. **Core Ingredient Positioning**
>     - Place the central ingredient, such as egg salad, potato and bean filling, smoked meat slices, or a substantial portion of brie cheese, as the innermost layer.
>     - Ensure the core ingredient occupies about one-third of the sandwich's cross-sectional area.
> 7. **Reverse Layering Sequence**
>     - Invert the layering order, placing the final bread slice on top of the sandwich.
> 8. **Settling Period**
>     - Allow the sandwich to settle for 2-3 minutes before consumption.
>     - This enables condiments and moisture to permeate the bread, enhancing taste and texture.
> 9. **Enjoying the Sandwich**
>     - Consume the sandwich as a whole or slice it for visual appeal.
>     - Appreciate the meticulously structured layers that contribute to both flavor and aesthetics.
