Welcome to Javalent's Plugins for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md "Obsidian"). 

You know 'em, you love 'em, now here is how to use them.

## The Fantasy System

With the Fantasy System of Plugins, you can enhance your Table Top Roleplaying experience in Obsidian.

The plugins prefixed with the ![d4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valentine195/fantasy-statblocks/b712e20446c08ff097280962dc127c5b39f82cef/images/Publish/dice-2.svg) / ![rolling-dice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valentine195/fantasy-statblocks/b712e20446c08ff097280962dc127c5b39f82cef/images/Publish/dices.svg) in the navigation pane are specifically designed for this purpose.

> [!tip] Popular Fantasy Plugins
> - [[Initiative Tracker|Initiative Tracker]] helps you keep track of encounter initiative, as well as current encounter Health and Conditions.
> - [[Dice Roller]] allows you to keep set up many forms of customized dice rolls within Obsidian.
> - [[Fantasy Statblocks|Fantasy Statblocks]] allows you to quickly generate detailed bestiary data, and augment them on the go.

In using these plugins in with your notes, you can create a dynamic and immersive world for your roleplaying adventures. Whether you're tracking character stats as a player, managing world-building details as game master, or keeping a detailed timeline of events as a writer, these plugins help provide the tools you need to bring the Valantasy to reality.

## Practical Plugins

In the Practical Plugins group, you can augment your Obsidian environment with quality of life tools that feel like they are core features. 

The plugins prefixed with ![Wand](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valentine195/fantasy-statblocks/b712e20446c08ff097280962dc127c5b39f82cef/images/Publish/wand.svg) / ![wand-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valentine195/fantasy-statblocks/b712e20446c08ff097280962dc127c5b39f82cef/images/Publish/wand-2.svg)  in the navigation pane are crafted with care to meet this design need.

>[!example] ** Popular Practical Plugins**
> - [[Admonitions|Admonitions]] is a plugin that enables you to create visually appealing callouts that have the stability and functionality of a code block. You may come across some examples of these callouts on this website.
> - [[Small Plugins/Second Window|Image Window]] is a reliable way to display content on a second screen from Obsidian. While the core function is built-in to Obsidian, it has certain limitations that are not present in Image/Second Window.
> - [[Markdown Attributes|Obsidian Markdown Attributes]] is a plugin that allows for a greater range of targeted CSS styling using markers like `{ .class }` and `{ id=example .myclass }` within notes.
