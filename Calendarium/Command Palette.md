# Command palette options

If you have the [Command Palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette) core plugin enabled, you can access the following commands:

## Open calendarium

This command opens a calendar view in the side panes, allowing you to conveniently interact with your calendar.

## Rescan events

Triggering this command prompts the plugin to rescan all notes across *all* calendars for any events, ensuring that the latest event data is captured and reflected in the calendar.

## Rescan events for calendar

Execute this command to initiate a rescan of all notes specifically for the chosen calendar. By doing so, the plugin updates the calendar with any new or modified events associated with that calendar.
