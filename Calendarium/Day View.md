# Day view

Within the small calendar, a right-click action on a specific day provides the option to "Open Day." By selecting this option, a day view pane is opened below the currently displayed month. 

This pane presents the current state of the moons and any events scheduled for that particular day.

## Modifying the current day

To modify the current day, various methods are available:

- Right-clicking on a specific day and choosing "Set as Today" will update the current day accordingly.
- The [[Calendarium/Sidebar view|Calendarium View Settings]] menu allows for changing the current day for a particular calendar.
- The [[Calendarium/Settings|Calendarium Settings]] also provide the option to edit the calendar directly, allowing for adjustments to the current day.
