> [!green] History of Obsidian Fantasy Calendar
>
> The Obsidian plugin version of Fantasy Calendar included features such as Leap Days and Intercalary Leap Days, as well as the ability to incorporate multiple Moons and Events. Users can also create Multi-day Events and use the Automatic Event Creation feature. The tool also includes a Plugin API for customization and allows users to Import Calendars from the Fantasy-Calendar webapp. The Fantasy Calendar plugin, which was originally created by Javalent as a fan-plugin for a website, was been merged with the Fantasy Calendar umbrella. 
> 
>  After a time working with the developers of Fantasy Calendar, Javalent decided to expand the features of the Calendar plugin (while retaining Fantasy Calendar support) beyond what Fantasy Calendar could offer, and rewrote the code to be entirely independent from Fantasy Calendar.
