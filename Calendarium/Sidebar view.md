After your Calendarium [Settings](Calendarium/Settings.md) and [Creating a Calendar](Calendarium/Creating%20a%20calendar.md) is completely set up, your sidebar view will display something akin to the screenshot example.

1. You will see the calendar name. Unless otherwise selected beforehand, or later, this will be your [Default Calendar](Calendarium/Settings.md#Default%20Calendar) you selected. 
2. You will have the option to choose the current view for this section of the Calendar: Week, Month, or Year. The active month will be highlighted in your accent color by default. This can be changed with CSS.
3. The current Month and Year of your calendar.
4. These three settings control your back, forth, and present navigation. 
   `<` navigates backwards in the view defined in **2**. 
   `>` navigates forwards in the current view defined in **2**. If in week view, it navigates 1 week. If in month view, it navigates back one month. If in Year view, it navigates back one year. 
   `Today` will reset the calendar to show where TODAY is in relation to your chosen option in **2**.
5. Calendar Settings, as described below.

### Show or hide moons

While the settings for this is in Sidebar View, the moons will only show up in [Day View](Calendarium/Day%20View.md). 

Similar to `Display Week Numbers`, this option toggles between `Show/Hide` dependent upon current state.
