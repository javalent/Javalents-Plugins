One area where Markdown attributes can be particularly useful is in typography, where they can help you achieve better formatting and layout of your text. By using attributes such as classes, IDs, and inline styles, you can control the appearance of headings, paragraphs, and other text elements in your Markdown document beyond the normal limitation of Markdown. This is especially helpful when creating complex documents such as technical manuals, academic papers, or character sheets, where clear and consistent formatting can make a big difference in readability and impact.
