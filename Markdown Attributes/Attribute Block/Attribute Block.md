In adding attributes directly to a block, you can change the formatting and style of the text, such as its background color or font. This can be particularly useful for organizing and visually differentiating different sections of a note. The syntax for adding attributes to blocks is straightforward, and can be added directly to various types of blocks, including paragraphs, blockquotes, and code blocks.
