The Second Window Settings in Obsidian provide two options. 

## Save Window Locations

This option saves the position of each window with a unique name. If this option is enabled, each window will open in its previous location.

> [!warning] Keep in mind that the window locations are saved per computer hostname. This means that a window saved on one computer won't be synced to another computer with a different hostname.

## Add New Named Window

The second option, Add New Named Window, allows you to create a new window with a custom name. 

If you click the [+] box on the right of the Add New Named Window option, a new window with a random name will be created. 

You can then edit the name of the new window within the same area you added it.

## Confirming Your Settings

If you are successful, when you right click or select a note you want to contextually open in a new Second Window, you should see the additional context menu options to open the window in.
