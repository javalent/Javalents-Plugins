In YAML, a value is defined as the data associated with a Key. It can be a scalar value, which is a single value like a number, string, or boolean, or a complex value like a list-value or a map.

**Scalar**

```yaml
Type: Dragon 
```

**List-Value**

```yaml
Type:
 - Dragon
 - Wyvern
 - Drake
 - Hatchling
```

**Map**

```yaml
Dragon:
  name: John Dragonson
  age: 3000
  occupation: Eater of Humans
```
