# Github Issue

An issue in GitHub is a feature that allows users to report a problem, request a new feature, or ask a question about a repository. Issues can be created by anyone with a GitHub account and are used to communicate with the repository's maintainers and contribute to its development. Issues can be labeled, assigned to specific users, and commented on by anyone with access to the repository. They are often used to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to software development projects.
