YAML is a way to write down information in a way that is easy for both humans and computers to understand. It's often used for things like configuration files, which tell a program how to work, or for storing data that needs to be shared between different programs. 

It uses simple and readable syntax with indentation to organize the data. However, as is a weakness of all indentation style languages, it is subject to breakdown if that indentation is not met as you may see in Fantasy Statblocks' [[Help and Support/YAML Validation Errors]] page.
