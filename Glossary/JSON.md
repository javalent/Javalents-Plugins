# Json

.JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and for machines to parse and generate. It is often used for transmitting data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML. Due to it's reliability, it is considered one of the premier archiving formats. StackOverflow block maintains a great primer on .json [here](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/06/02/a-beginners-guide-to-json-the-data-format-for-the-internet/).
