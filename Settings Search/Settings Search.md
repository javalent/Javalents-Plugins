*This plugin adds global search to the Obsidian settings.*

That's it. That's the plugin. 😐 How about a short song for your time?

```text
Of searching high and searching low, 
This plugin augments my work flow. 
To Obsidian's settings, oh so grand, 
A tool to help me take command.

No longer must I hunt and peck,
For settings buried deep in a wreck.
With trusty plugin at my side,
The search for settings will subsi-i-i-i-i-i-ide!

Oh settings search, you're so profound,
Oh settings search, how you astound.
Obsidian's settings, now clear and true,
Obsidian's settings, how I love yooooouuuuuu!
