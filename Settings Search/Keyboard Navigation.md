In addition to standard mouse functionality, this plugin is fully keyboard enabled in that you can use the keyboard to navigate the search results.

The **Up** (↑) and **Down** (↓) arrow keys can be used to move through the results, and the **Enter/Return** (↳) button will take you to the setting.

Once you hit **Enter/Return**, the Settings Search Bar will remain in focus (or Highlighted) until you navigate away from it.
